# Plumbum

A fork of [Indium](https://github.com/comp500/Indium) in an attempt to add FREX support to Sodium.

The name means the chemical element *Pb*, and also "plumbing", in reference to the rendering *pipe*line. Pretty genius, I know.

## Current State

So far, custom FRAPI models render without texture (but hey, they aren't invisible!)

FREX's features aren't implemented yet.

Dependency on FRAPI is still required to differentiate vanilla baked models.
