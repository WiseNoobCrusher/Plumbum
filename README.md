# Plumbum

![Plumbum Icon](./src/main/resources/assets/plumbum/icon.png)

A fork of [Indium](https://github.com/comp500/Indium) in an attempt to add FREX support to Sodium.

The name means the chemical element *Pb*, and also "plumbing", in reference to the rendering *pipe*line. Pretty genius, I know.

## Current State

**This mod is currently experimental and temporary.** Possible merging with upstream Indium is being considered and deliberated.

Custom FRAPI models render properly! Tested with Campanion, LambdaBetterGrass, and Continuity.

FREX extended features are technically implemented, but they are likely ignored. More support are added gradually. It hasn't been tested against pure FREX implementation at the time of writing.

Still depends on FRAPI to differentiate vanilla baked models.
