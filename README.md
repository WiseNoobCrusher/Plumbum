# Plumbum

![Plumbum Icon](./src/main/resources/assets/plumbum/icon.png)

A fork of [Indium](https://github.com/comp500/Indium) in an attempt to add FREX support to Sodium.

The name means the chemical element *Pb*, and also "plumbing", in reference to the rendering *pipe*line. Pretty genius, I know.

## Current State

**This mod is currently experimental and temporary.** Possible merging with upstream Indium is being considered and deliberated.

Custom FREX and FRAPI models render properly! Tested with Campanion, LambdaBetterGrass, Continuity, and Exotic blocks.

All of FREX material properties that are supported by Pastel are supported at least partially. More support are added gradually.
